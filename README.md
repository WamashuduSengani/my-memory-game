# Getting Started with Memory Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

Memory (also known as Concentration) is a card game played with one or more players. The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

## Rules:

The game consists of 2 players.
Only 1 player can play at a time.
The deck of cards is automatically shuffled.
All 54 cards (including jokers) are automatically displayed face down.
Clicking the back of a card should turn it over.
A player can turn over 2 cards at a time.
When two cards are turned over:
If the number and color of the cards match, the player collects the pair and the cards are removed from the board.
If the cards do not match, they are turned back over and remain in position.
The player with the most collected pairs wins.
